                                =======


A clone of our beloveth tuXeyes, depending only on xlib.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11

tuxeye2 expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

To build the program, run:

    $ make

To specify the path to the themes (will use the current directory if
unset):

    $ make THEME_PATH=/usr/share/tuxeye2


Running
-------

Just call it:

    $ tuxeye2

This runs tuxeye2 as a regular (undecorated) window that you can move
around on your screen using your window manager. If you right-click on
Tux, the program will exit.

If you left-click, it will print its current position. You can use this
information to instruct your window manager to launch the program at a
predefined position.
